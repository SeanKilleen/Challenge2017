# Excella Code Challege 2017 -- .NET Starter Kit
A starter kit by Sean Killeen for submitting answers to the Excella coding challenge 2017

## What Does This Project Contain?
* A working .NET WebAPI 2 Endpoint that solves the `HelloWorld` (round 0) question
 * This can be found at `/api/HelloWorld`
* A Swagger API Documentation Controller at `/swagger`. This will show all of the controllers and their options, and will enable a live "playground" where you can test the results.
