# Excella Code Challege 2017 -- .NET Starter Kit
A starter kit by Sean Killeen for submitting answers to the Excella coding challenge 2017

## What Does This Project Contain?
* The default Home Page at `/Home` or the default URL. I haven't modified this from the out of the box demo page.
* A working .NET WebAPI 2 Endpoint that solves the `HelloWorld` (round 0) question
 * This can be found at `/api/HelloWorld`
* Unit tests for the HelloWorld controller in a separate project to get you started.
 * These tests are written using [xUnit](https://xunit.github.io/) and [FluentAssertions](http://www.fluentassertions.com/).
* A Swagger API Documentation Controller at `/swagger`. This will show all of the controllers and their options, and will enable a live "playground" where you can test the results.

## Cloning This Repository
If you'd like to use this as a starting point, you'll need to clone the repository.

* Open the repository on the Github Web site
* Click the `Clone or Download` button and choose the option you prefer.

Optionally, follow the steps to clone the git repository in your client of choice.

## Building the application locally
This should be pretty straightforward. The apps should build using the standard `CTRL + SHIFT + B` or `F5` that you're used to.

The tests should run in any standard test runner. My preferred runner is [NCrunch](http://ncrunch.com).

## Deploying the app to Microsoft Azure
For the purposes of the challenge, you may want to deploy the app to a public web site.

Luckily, with Microoft Azure, you can host this web app completely for free!

Read on below, or try the handy button below if you're familiar with it once you've cloned the repository:

#### Step 1: Sign up for Microsoft Azure (or log in)
If you haven't already, head to <http://portal.azure.com> and create an account.

#### Create a Free Web Site to Hold the App
